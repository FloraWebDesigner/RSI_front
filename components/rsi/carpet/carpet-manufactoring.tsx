        title="Wool Sourcing & Preparation"
        description="As a third-generation carpet manufacturer, we begin just as our forefathers did—by sourcing the finest wool from free-grazing sheep. The wool is sheared and washed by hand, without any chemicals, to preserve its natural oils and strength. This step has been passed down for generations as the foundation of a truly long-lasting rug."

        title="Dyeing"
        description="We honor traditional dyeing techniques using natural, plant-based dyes—a practice perfected over decades. Our artisans dye each batch by hand, allowing the fibers to absorb rich, earthy tones that age beautifully over time. This chemical-free approach gives our carpets their signature warmth and timeless appeal."

        title="Spinning"
        description="Our yarns are hand-spun the same way they were in our grandfather's workshop. Using wooden spinning wheels, skilled hands create unique textures that modern machines can't replicate. It's in these small imperfections that our rugs gain their character—something only a family-run legacy can offer."

        title="Designing & Mapping"
        description="Designs are inspired by generations of family artistry. Some are drawn from memory, others mapped carefully by hand, always reflecting cultural heritage and craftsmanship. Whether it’s a tribal motif or a floral medallion, each pattern carries the imprint of decades of experience and pride."

        title="Weaving / Knotting"
        description="Weaving is where tradition comes to life. Each rug is hand-knotted by skilled artisans—some of whom have worked with our family for decades. Depending on size and complexity, a single rug can take months to complete. This is slow, honest work, made the way our family has done it for over 70 years."

        title="Washing & Drying"
        description="After weaving, every rug is washed by hand using natural soap and fresh water—never bleach or industrial cleaners. The carpets are then dried under open skies, just as they were when our grandfather laid them out in the sun. This careful, chemical-free process enhances both the softness and the colors."

        title="Finishing & Trimming"
        description="Once dried, the rug is trimmed, bound, and detailed—entirely by hand. No step is rushed, and every rug is personally inspected before it leaves our workshop. Our family's name is tied to every piece, and we make sure it reflects our generational standards of quality and integrity."
